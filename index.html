                    <p>A good designer knows how to create a beautiful aesthetic, how to challenge accepted norms, and how to generate satisfying, engaging concepts to sell an idea.</p><br>
                    <p>A great designer can always know more. Any person in a creative field knows that their vision will (not "might") eventually be met with revisions, radical changes and production limitations driven by engineering, manufacturing, or other factors beyond what one's imagination can generate. This site is a partial guide to collecting the skills and knowledge necessary to become a professional capable of predicting and adapting to real-world problems with respect to the lifecycle of a design.</p>
                    Let's dig in!

                        <h3>What is Consummate Design?</h3>
                        <h4>An introduction to being a proactive designer.</h4>
                    </header>
                    <div class="article-body">
                        <p>In short, to  be consummate is to be complete. When we start at as designers, and especially as product designers, we're often consumed exclusively with improving a very narrow range of skills. We want to be excellent at drawing; we want to have a good sense of linewieght and color; we want to do it quickly. Hopefully after many hours of practice and instruction we can put out concepts that we can take to a client and have them say "wow, I want that to be real."</p><br>
                        <p>Unfortunately, I think that many designers are forced to let go of the baby too soon. All too often, the concept phase ends with a client loving the look of what is essentially smoke and mirrors. The demands on new designers require speed and aesthetic vision - to accomplish this, we can't become mired in details too early else nothing gets completed on time.</p><br>
                        <p>There's the assumption that engineering (which is a term I will use to indicate a person or team who translates a concept into something manufacturable with drawings and models) will be able to figure out how to make the concept a reality. The other assumption some designers (and clents) make is that engineering is perfect. We'll circle back to that in another section, but engineering, even in aerospace or automative, is never perfect.</p><br>
                        <p>So what am I really proposing? It's not that I believe all designers should be engineers. Rather, there are always going to be problems that engineering has to solve in order to make a reality out of a concept. In a lot of cases, this means changing the concept to make it possible. Sometimes this involves a feedback dialogue between the designer and engineering. Other times, your initial (and approved) concept are modified without your input.</p><br>
                        <p>Therefore, I'd like you to imagine for a second that those "common problems" that engineering tends to face are actually problems you as a designer have already solved so many times that they're second nature to the creative process. A consummate designer, then, knows from the outset what challenges a given concept will be met with and designs in such a way as to minimize changes based on those challenges. For example, knowing:</p><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Where mounting bosses will be</li>
                            <li>What processes will be used to create the product</li>
                            <li>Costs of off-the-shelf hardware being used</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <p>will all radically improved the chances that a design you create will retain as much of your vision as possible. This is what it means to be proactive; rather than reacting to prescribed (and probably inevitable!) changes, know what they'll be before they even get the chance.</p><br>
                        </p>That said, I do have a small warning before jumping into the next sections. Don't let this guide convince you that change is bad. Ideas are meant to evolve as they're passed between people. We are very good as a species at collaborating and you do your creative mind a disservice by shutting out the possiblity of change. Instead, I want this to be motivation to learn more than you know now so that you become a stronger, more complete, and necessarily more desirable team member.</p>
